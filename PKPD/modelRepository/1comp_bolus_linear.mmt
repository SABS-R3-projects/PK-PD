[[model]]
name: Linear, single-compartment PK model of drug concentration with bolus injection. The default protocol is a single injection, but can be adjusted in the GUI.

# Initial values
centralCompartment.drug = 0 [ng]

[centralCompartment]
# bound variables (dosing controlled by the protocol, and time)
doseRate = 0 [ng/h]
    in [ng/h]
    bind pace
    desc: Dose rate in ng/h. Controlled by protocol.
time = 0 [h]
    in [h]
    bind time
    desc: independent time variable in h.

# compartment internal parameters
CL = 2 [mL/h]
    in [mL/h]
    desc: Clearance/elimination rate from central compartment.
V = 4 [mL]
    in [mL]
    desc: Volume of central compartment.

# state variable
dot(drug) = doseRate - drug * CL / V
    in [ng]
    desc: Drug in central compartment in ng.

# convert to concentration
drugConcentration = drug / V
    in [ng/mL]
    desc: Drug concentration in central compartment in ng/mL.
